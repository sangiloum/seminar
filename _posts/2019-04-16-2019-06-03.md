<div class="abstract">
  Let $Q_n$ be the $n$-dimensional Hamming cube (hypercube) and $N=2^n$. We prove that the number of maximal independent sets in $Q_n$ is asymptotically $2n2^{N/4}$, as was conjectured by Ilinca and Kahn in connection with a question of Duffus, Frankl and Rödl. The value is a natural lower bound derived from a connection between maximal independent sets and induced matchings. The proof of the upper bound draws on various tools, among them &#8220;stability&#8221; results for maximal independent set counts and old and new results on isoperimetric behavior in $Q_n$. This is joint work with Jeff Kahn.
