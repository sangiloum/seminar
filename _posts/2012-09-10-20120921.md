<div class="abstract">
  In 1935 Erdős and Szekeres showed that every &#8220;sufficiently large&#8221; set of points in general position in the plane contains a &#8220;large&#8221; subset which is in convex position. Since then many mathematicians have tried to determine good bounds for &#8220;sufficiently large&#8221; in  terms of &#8220;large&#8221;, as well as given numerous generalizations and refinements. In this talk I will survey this famous problem and extend it to a natural object which we call generalized wiring diagram. This unifies several proposed generalizations, and as a result we will settle several conjectures in this area. This is joint work with Michael Dobbins and Alfredo Hubard.
