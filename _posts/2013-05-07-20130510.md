<div class="abstract">
  Tropical Laplacian is a symmetric square matrix associated to a balanced graph on a sphere, defined in a similar way to the Laplacian of an abstract graph. We will see by examples how tropical Laplacian appears in the study of polytopes, matroids, and graphs. The speaker will pose many linear-algebra-level questions to audiences.
