<div class="abstract">
  In patrolling problems, several mobile agents move inside a given region and try to cooperate so that every designated point in the region is (perpetually) visited sufficiently often (that is, no point should be left unattended for any time period of specified length). There are many variants of this problem: the agents may have the same or different speeds; the terrain may be a line, a cycle, or more general graphs; the points to be visited may be the whole or a (finite) part of the terrain. Problems of this kind are studied in different contexts with various motivations, but finding an optimal patrolling strategy is not straightforward, even in very simple settings. For example, the optimal patrolling of a line segment by several agents is not always achieved by the simple strategy where each agent moves back and forth in a sub-segment of length proportional to its speed. This talk will introduce some positive and negative results and open questions about properties of and algorithms for optimal patrolling.
