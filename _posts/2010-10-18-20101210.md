    The Helly number of a collection of sets is the size of its largest inclusionwise minimal subfamily with empty intersection. The precise conditions that lead to bounded Helly numbers have been studied since the 1920&#8217;s, when Helly showed that the Helly number of any collection of compact convex sets in R<sup>d</sup> has Helly number at most d+1.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I will discuss a proof that any collection of subsets of R<sup>d</sup> where the intersection of any subfamily consists of at most r connected components, each of which is contractible, has Helly number at most r(d+1). I will show how this implies, in a unified manner, quantitative bounds for several Helly-type theorems in geometric transversal theory.

    Our main ingredients are a new variant of the nerve, a &#8220;homological nerve theorem&#8221; for this structure and an extension of a projection theorem of Kalai and Meshulam.

    This is joint work with Eric Colin de Verdiere and Gregory Ginot.
