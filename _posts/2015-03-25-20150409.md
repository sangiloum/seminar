<div class="abstract">
  Orthogonal polynomials are a family of polynomials which are orthogonal with respect to certain inner product. The n-th moment of orthogonal polynomials is an important quantity, which is given as an integral. In 1983 Viennot found a combinatorial expression for moments using lattice paths. In this talk we will compute the moments of several important orthogonal polynomials using Viennot&#8217;s theory. We will also see their connections with continued fractions, matchings, set partitions, and permutations.
