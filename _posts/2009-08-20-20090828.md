    The fractional weak discrepancy of a poset (partially ordered set) P, written wd(P), is the least k such that some <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3AP%5Cto%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='f:P\to\mathbb{R}' title='f:P\to\mathbb{R}' class='latex' /> satisfies f(y)-f(x)≤1 for <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cprec+y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='x\prec y' title='x\prec y' class='latex' /> and |f(y)-f(x)|≤k for x|y. Minimal forbidden subposets are often called <i>obstructions</i>. Shuchat, Shull, and Trenk determined the obstructions for the property wd(P)<1: the obstructions are <b>2</b>+<b>2</b> and <b>3</b>+<b>1</b>. We determine the obstructions for the property wd(P)≤k when k is an integer. In this talk, the complete collection of the obstructions for wd(P)≤k for each k≥2 &#8211; which is an infinite set &#8211; will be discussed.
