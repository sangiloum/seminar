<div class="abstract">
  <p>
    Given a hypergraph H = (V,E), a coloring of its vertices is said to be <em>conflict-free</em> if for every hyperedge S âˆˆ E there is at least one vertex whose color is distinct from the colors of all other vertices in S. The study of this notion is motivated by frequency assignment problems in wireless networks. We introduce and study the list-coloring (or choice) version of this notion. Joint work with Panagiotis Cheilaris.
