  We prove that every infinite sequence of skew-symmetric or symmetric matrices M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, … over a fixed finite field must have a pair M<sub>i</sub>, M<sub>j</sub> (i<j) such that that M<sub>i</sub> is isomorphic to a principal submatrix of the Schur complement of a nonsingular principal submatrix in M<sub>j</sub>, if those matrices have bounded rank-width. This generalizes three theorems on well-quasi-ordering of graphs or matroids admitting good tree-like decompositions; (1) Robertson and Seymour&#8217;s theorem for graphs of bounded tree-width, (2) Geelen, Gerards, and Whittle&#8217;s theorem for matroids representable over a fixed finite field having bounded branch-width, and (3) Oum&#8217;s theorem for graphs of bounded rank-width with respect to pivot-minors.

<div class="abstract">
  A non-complete distance-regular graph Γ is called geometric if there exists a set C of Delsarte cliques such that each edge of Γ lies in a unique clique in C. In this talk, we determine the non-complete distance-regular graphs satisfying max{3,8(a<sub>1</sub>+1)/3}<k<4a<sub>1</sub>+10−6c<sub>2</sub>. To prove this result, we first show by considering non-existence of 4-claws that any non-complete distance-regular graph satisfying max{3,8(a<sub>1</sub>+1)/3}<k<4a<sub>1</sub>+10−6c<sub>2</sub> is a geometric distance-regular graph with smallest eigenvalue −3. Moreover, we classify the geometric distance-regular graphs with smallest eigenvalue −3. As an application, 7 feasible intersection arrays are ruled out.

  The H-colouring Dichotomy through a projective property

<div class="abstract">
  The H-colouring Dichotomy of Hell and Nesetril, proved in 1990, is one of the most quoted results in the field of Graph Homomorphisms. It says that H-coloring, the problem of deciding if a given graph G admits an homomorphism to the fixed graph H, is NP-complete if H contains an odd cycle, and otherwise polynomial time solvable.<br /> In this talk we present a short new proof of this result, recently published, using a new projective property defined for homomorphisms of powers of a graph G onto a graph H.

  On second Hamilton circuits in cubic graphs

</div>

<div class="abstract">
  A classical theorem of Cedric Smith guarantees the existence of a second Hamilton circuit other than a given one in any hamiltonian cubic graph. It is an open problem in complexity theory whether the corresponding search problem is polynomially solvable. We observe that a search algorithm, implicit in Bill Tutte&#8217;s nonconstructive proof of Smith&#8217;s theorem, has exponential running time. We also mention two possible candidates for search algorithms with polynomial complexity.

  Thue choice number of graphs

<div class="abstract">
  A sequence of even length is a repetition if the first half is identical to the second half. A sequence is said to contain a repetition if it has a subsequence which is a repetition. A classical result of Thue says that there is an infinite sequence on 3 symbols which contains no repetition. This result motivated many deep research and challenging problems. One graph concept related to this result is Thue-colouring. A Thue-colouring of a graph G is a mapping which assigns to each vertex of G a colour (a symbol) in such a way that the colour sequence of any path of G contains no repetition. The Thue-chromatic number of a graph is the minimum number of colours needed in a Thue-colouring of G. Thue&#8217;s result is equivalent to say that the infinite path has Thue-chromatic number 3. It is also known that the Thue-chromatic number of any tree is at most 4.<br /> Thue-choice number of a graph G is the list version of its Thue-chromatic number, which is the minimum integer k such that if each vertex of G is given k-permissible colours, then there is a Thue-colouring of G using a permissible colour for each vertex. This talk will survey some research related to Thue Theorem and will show that Thue-choice number of paths is at most 4 and Thue choice number of trees are unbounded.
