<div class="abstract">
  The continuity problem is the question when effective (or Markov computable) maps between effectively given topological spaces are effectively continuous. It will be shown that this is always the case if the the range of the map is effectively bi-regular. As will be shown, such spaces appear quite naturally in the context of the problem.
