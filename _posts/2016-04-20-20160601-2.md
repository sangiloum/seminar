<div class="abstract">
  Recently, Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava proved the existence of infinite families of bipartite Ramanujan graphs of every degree at least 3 by using the method of interlacing families of polynomials. In this talk, we apply their method to prove that for any connected graph G, there exists an orientation of G such that the spectral radius of the corresponding Hermitian adjacency matrix is at most that of the universal cover of G.
