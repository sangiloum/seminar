Lecture 4: Graphs and Sumsets (Schrijver-Seymour) [(LECTURE NOTE)](http://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/~sangil/seminar/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/lec4.pdf)

<div class="abstract">
  I intend to give an introduction to some of the wonderful topics in the world of additive combinatorics. This is a broad subject which features numerous different tools and techniques, and is presently a hotbed of exciting research. My focus will be on the combinatorics, and I will keep things as basic as possible (I will assume nothing more than a basic background in combinatorics). I’ll begin the tour with some of the classical theorems like Cauchy-Davenport and Erdos-Ginzburg-Ziv and I will exhibit some very clean proofs of these and other results such as the Theorems of Schrijver-Seymour, Green-Ruzsa, Dvir, and Elekes. We will also discuss (but not prove) some more recent results like the Breulliard-Green-Tao Theorem.
