<div class="abstract">
  We prove that if T<sub>1</sub>,&#8230;, T<sub>n</sub> is a sequence of bounded degree trees so that T<sub>i</sub> has i vertices, then K<sub>n</sub> has a decomposition into T<sub>1</sub>,&#8230;, T<sub>n</sub>. This shows that the tree packing conjecture of Gyárfás and Lehel from 1976 holds for all bounded degree trees.<br /> We deduce this result from a more general theorem, which yields decompositions of dense quasi-random graphs into suitable families of bounded degree graphs.<br /> In this talk, we discuss the ideas used in the proof.<br /> This is joint work with Felix Joos, Daniela Kühn and Deryk Osthus.
