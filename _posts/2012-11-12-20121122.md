<div class="abstract">
  For a hypergraph G and a positive integer c, let &chi;<sub>&ell;</sub>(G,c) be the minimum value of &ell; such that G is L-colorable from every list L with |L(v)|=&ell; for each v&in;V(G) and |L(u)&cap;L(v)|&le;c for all e=uv&in;E(G). This parameter was studied by Kratochvíl, Tuza and Voigt for various kinds of graphs. In this talk, we present the asymptotics of &chi;<sub>&ell;</sub>(G,c) for complete graphs, complete multipartite graphs and hypergraphs. This is a joint work with Z. Füredi and A. Kostochka.
