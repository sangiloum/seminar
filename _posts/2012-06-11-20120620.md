<div class="abstract">
  We present an approach for structured integer programs that solves well-chosen restrictions of the problem to produce high-quality solutions quickly. Column generation is used both for automatically generating the restrictions and for producing bounds on the value of an optimal solution. We present computational experience for fixed-charge multi-commodity flow and inventory routing problems.
