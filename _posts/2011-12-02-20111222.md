<div class="abstract">
  Given a fixed alphabet, a <em>word</em> of length n is an n-tuple with entries in the alphabet. A <em>hole</em> is a character outside the alphabet that is viewed as representing any letter of the alphabet. A <em>partial word</em> is a string where each character is a hole or belongs to the alphabet. Two partial words having the same length are <em>compatible</em> if they agree at each position where neither has a hole.<br /> A <em>square</em> is a word formed by concatenating two copies of a single word (no holes). A partial word W <em>contains</em> a square S if S is compatible with some (consecutive) subword of W. Let g(h,s) denote the maximum length of a binary partial word with h holes that contains at most s distinct squares. We prove that g(h,s)=∞ when s≥4 and when s=3 with h∈{0,1,2}; otherwise, g(h,s) is finite. Furthermore, we extend our research to cube-free binary partial words.<br /> This is joint work with Dr. Francine Blanchet-Sadri and Robert Mercas.
