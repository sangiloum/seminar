<div class="abstract">
  We provide a combinatorial characterization of all testable properties of k-graphs (i.e. k-uniform hypergraphs).<br /> Here, a k-graph property ? is testable if there is a randomized algorithm which quickly distinguishes with high probability between k-graphs that satisfy ? and those that are far from satisfying ?. For the 2-graph case, such a combinatorial characterization was obtained by Alon, Fischer, Newman and Shapira. This is joint work with Felix Joos, Deryk Osthus and Daniela Kühn.
