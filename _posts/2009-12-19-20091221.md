<div class="abstract">
  <p>
    I am going to give a survey on several basic problems of combinatorial nature concerning random Bernoulli matrices, including:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (1) The singularity problem: What is the probability that a random Bernoulli matrix is singular?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (2) The determinant problem: What is the typical value of the determinant?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (3) The permanent problem: What is the typical value of the permanent?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (4) The eigenvector problem: How does a typical eigenvector look like?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If time allows, I will discuss connections to other areas of mathematics, most importantly additive combinatorics.
