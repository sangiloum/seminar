<div class="abstract">
  One of the cornerstones of extremal graph theory is a result of Füredi, later reproved and given due prominence by Alon, Krivelevich and Sudakov, saying that if H is a bipartite graph with maximum degree r on one side, then there is a constant C such that every graph with n vertices and C n<sup>2 &#8211; 1/r</sup> edges contains a copy of H. This result is tight up to the constant when H contains a copy of K<sub>r,s</sub> with s sufficiently large in terms of r. We conjecture that this is essentially the only situation in which Füredi&#8217;s result can be tight and prove this conjecture for r = 2. More precisely, we show that if H is a C<sub>4</sub>-free bipartite graph with maximum degree 2 on one side, then there are positive constants C and &delta; such that every graph with n vertices and C n<sup>3/2 &#8211; &delta;</sup> edges contains a copy of H. This answers a question by Erdős from 1988. The proof relies on a novel variant of the dependent random choice technique which may be of independent interest. This is joint work with David Conlon.
