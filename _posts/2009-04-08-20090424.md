    The Cycle Double Cover Problem in Graph Theory suggests that all 2-connected graphs share a certain property with 2-connected planar maps. Such a map clearly contains a collection of cycles, indeed the boundary cycles of its faces, such that each edge belongs to exactly<br /> two of them. The generalization of this property to nonplanar graphs remains one of the central open problems in Graph Theory.

    We investigate this problem by generalizing a suitable variation of the statement of another almost obvious property of planar maps, namely the Jordan Curve Theorem. The generalization suggests a new conjecture which is much stronger than the Cycle Double Cover Conjecture. In fact it would imply a very strong form of the Cycle Double Cover Conjecture, suggesting that every cycle in a 2-connected graph appears in at least one cycle double cover of the graph.

    We prove the stronger conjecture in a few important special cases.
