<div class="abstract">
  The game of SET is a popular card game in which the objective is to form Sets (triplets of cards that match in a particular sense) using cards from a special deck. For more details regarding the game, please visit the official website: http://www.setgame.com/.<br /> We analyze the computational complexity of some variations of the game of SET, presenting positive as well as hardness results in the classical and parameterized sense. Along the way, we make interesting connections of these generalizations of the game with other combinatorial problems, like Perfect Multi-Dimensional Matching, Set Packing, Independent Edge Dominating Set, and a two-player game played on graphs called Arc Kayles.
