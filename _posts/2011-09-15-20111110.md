<div class="abstract">
  Submodular functions are discrete analogues of convex functions. Examples include cut capacity functions, matroid rank functions, and entropy functions. Submodular functions can be minimized in polynomial time, which provides a fairly general framework of efficiently solvable combinatorial optimization problems. In contrast, the maximization problems are NP-hard and several approximation algorithms have been developed so far.<br /> In this talk, I will review the above results in submodular optimization and present recent approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems described in terms of submodular functions.
