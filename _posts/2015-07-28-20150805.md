<div class="abstract">
  An order-t Markov chain is a discrete process where the outcome of each trial is linearly determined by the outcome of most recent t trials. The set of outcomes can be modelled by functions from a set V to a set F. The linear influences can be described as t-linear maps. When t=1, the set of linear influences can be conveniently described as digraphs on the vertex set V. Most of our talk is concerned with a combinatorial counterpart of Markov chains, where we can only tell the difference between zero probability and positive probability. We especially focus on the Boolean case, namely F is a 2-element set. This talk is to introduce several easy-to-state combinatorial problems about discrete dynamics, which arise from the combinatorial considerations of Markov chains.
