<div class="abstract">
  <p>
    Hajos&#8217; conjecture is false, and it seems that graphs without a subdivision of a big complete graph do not behave as well as those without a minor of a big complete graph.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In fact, the graph minor theorem (a proof of Wagner&#8217;s conjecture) is not true if we replace the minor relation by the subdivision relation. I.e, For every infinite sequence G<sub>1</sub>,G<sub>2</sub>, &#8230; of graphs, there exist distinct integers i<j such that G<sub>i</sub> is a minor of G<sub>j</sub>, but if we replace &#8221;minor&#8221; by &#8221;subdivision&#8221;, this is no longer true.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This is partially because we do not really know what the graphs without a subdivision of a big complete graph look like.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In this talk, we shall discuss this issue. In particular, assuming some moderate connectivity condition, we can say something, which we will present in this talk.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Topics also include coloring graphs without a subdivision of a large complete graph, and some algorithmic aspects. Some of the results are joint work with Theo Muller.
