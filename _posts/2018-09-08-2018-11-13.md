<div class="abstract">
  In the k-cut problem, we are given an edge-weighted graph G and an integer k, and have to remove a set of edges with minimum total weight so that G has at least k connected components. This problem has been studied various algorithmic perspectives including randomized algorithms, fixed-parameter tractable algorithms, and approximation algorithms. Their proofs of performance guarantees often reveal elegant structures for cuts in graphs.<br /> It has still remained an open problem to (a) improve the runtime of exact algorithms, and (b) to get better approximation algorithms. In this talk, I will give an overview on recent progresses on both exact and approximation algorithms. Our algorithms are inspired by structural similarities between k-cut and the k-clique problem.
