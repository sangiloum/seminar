  <p>
    A set A of integers is a <em>Sidon set</em> if all the sums a<sub>1</sub>+a<sub>2</sub>, with a<sub>1</sub>≤a<sub>2</sub> and a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>∈A, are distinct. In the 1940s, Chowla, Erdős and Turán showed that the maximum possible size of a Sidon set contained in [n]={0,1,&#8230;,n-1} is √n (1+o(1)). We study Sidon sets contained in sparse random sets of integers, replacing the ‘dense environment’ [n] by a sparse, random subset R of [n].

    Let R=[n]<sub>m</sub> be a uniformly chosen, random m-element subset of [n]. Let F([n]<sub>m</sub>)=max {|S| : S⊆[n]<sub>m</sub> Sidon}. An abridged version of our results states as follows. Fix a constant 0≤a≤1 and suppose m=m(n)=(1+o(1))n<sup>a</sup>. Then there is a constant b=b(a) for which F([n]<sub>m</sub>)=n<sup>b+o(1)</sup> almost surely. The function b=b(a) is a continuous, piecewise linear function of a, not differentiable at two points: a=1/3 and a=2/3; between those two points, the function b=b(a) is constant. This is joint work with Yoshiharu Kohayakawa and Vojtech Rödl.
