    Hadwiger&#8217;s conjecture is a well known open problem in graph theory. It states that every graph with chromatic number k, contains a certain structure, called a &#8220;clique minor&#8221; of size k. An interesting special case of the conjecture, that is still wide open, is when the graph G does not contain three pairwise non-adjacent vertices. In this case, it should be true that G contains a clique minor of size t where <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t+%3D+%5Clceil+%7CV%28G%29%7C%2F2+%5Crceil&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='t = \lceil |V(G)|/2 \rceil' title='t = \lceil |V(G)|/2 \rceil' class='latex' />. This remains open, but Jonah Blasiak proved it in the subcase when |V(G)| is even and the vertex set of G is the union of three cliques. Here we prove a strengthening of Blasiak&#8217;s result: that the conjecture holds if some clique in G contains at least |V(G)|/4 vertices.

    This is a consequence of a result about packing &#8220;seagulls&#8221;. A <em>seagull</em> in G is an induced three-vertex path. It is not known in general how to decide in polynomial time whether a graph contains k pairwise disjoint seagulls; but we answer this for graphs with no stable sets of size three.
