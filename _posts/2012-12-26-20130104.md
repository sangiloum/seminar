<div class="abstract">
  The cube graph Q<sub>n</sub> is the skeleton of the n-dimensional cube. It is an n-regular graph on 2<sup>n</sup> vertices. The Ramsey number r(Q<sub>n</sub>, K<sub>s</sub>) is the minimum N such that every graph of order N contains the cube graph Q<sub>n</sub> or an independent set of order s. Burr and Erdős in 1983 asked whether the simple lower bound r(Q<sub>n</sub>, K<sub>s</sub>) &ge; (s-1)(2<sup>n</sup> -1)+1 is tight for s fixed and n sufficiently large. We make progress on this problem, obtaining the first upper bound which is within a constant factor of the lower bound.<br /> Joint work w/ David Conlon, Jacob Fox, and Benny Sudakov
