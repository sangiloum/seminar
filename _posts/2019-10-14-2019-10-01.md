<div class="abstract">
  Given a graph $G$, there are several natural hypergraph families one can define. Among the least restrictive is the family $BG$ of so-called Berge copies of the graph $G$. In this talk, we discuss Turán problems for families $BG$ in $r$-uniform hypergraphs for various graphs $G$. In particular, we are interested in general results in two settings: the case when $r$ is large and $G$ is any graph where this Turán number is shown to be eventually subquadratic, as well as the case when $G$ is a tree where several exact results can be obtained. The results in the first part are joint with Grósz and Methuku, and the second part with Győri, Salia and Zamora.
