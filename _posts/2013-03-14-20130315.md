<div class="abstract">
  In this talk we deal with extremal results on combinatorial number theory. A typical problem is as follows. We fix a family of linear equations (for example, a+b=2c or a+b=c+d). Then we want to estimate the maximum size of subsets with no solution of the given equations in {1,2,&#8230;,n} or a random subset of {1,2,&#8230;,n} of size m < n. We consider two important examples:</p> 
  
  <p>
    (1) Sets which contain no arithmetic progression of a fixed size
  </p>
  
  <p>
    (2) Sidon sets (without solutions of a+b=c+d)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The first example is about the results of Roth in 1953 and Szemeredi in 1975, and the recent results by Schacht in 2009+, and Conlon-Gowers in 2010+.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Next, the second example is about the results by Erd&#337;s, Tur&aacute;n, Chowla, Singer in 1940s and the results by Kohayakawa, Lee, R&ouml;dl, and Samotij in 2012+.
