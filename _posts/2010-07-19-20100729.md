  <p>
    Self-dual codes have become one of the most active research areas in coding theory due to their rich mathematical theories. In this talk, we start with an introduction to coding theory. Then we describe some recent results on the constructions of self-dual codes over rings, and applications to lattices and network coding theory. We conclude the talk with some open problems.
