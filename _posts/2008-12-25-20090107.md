<div class="abstract">
  Finite graphs can be viewed, in many respects, as discrete analogues<br /> of algebraic curves. In this talk, we consider this analogy in the<br /> context of linear equivalence of divisors on a graph. We will state a<br /> graph-theoretic version of the <em>Riemann-Roch theorem</em>, and outline its<br /> proof. Additionally, we will discuss harmonic morphisms between graphs<br /> and connections of our results to tropical geometry. This is joint<br /> work with Matt Baker.
