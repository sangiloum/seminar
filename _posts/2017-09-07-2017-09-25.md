<div class="abstract">
  In combinatorial and computational geometry, the complexity of a system of sets is often studied via its shatter function. I will introduce these functions, and discuss how their asymptotic growth rate is governed from a single of its values, in the spirit of the classical notion of &#8220;Vapnik-Chernonenkis dimension&#8221; of hypergraphs. In particular, I will describe a probabilistic construction that refutes a conjecture of Bondy and Hajnal. This is joint work with Boris Bukh (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06632">https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06632</a>). The talk will start from first principles.
