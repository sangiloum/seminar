<div class="abstract">
  A classical result of Komlós, Sárközy and Szemerédi states that every n-vertex graph with minimum degree at least (1/2 +o(1))n contains every n-vertex tree with maximum degree at most O(n/log n) as a subgraph, and the bounds on the degree conditions are sharp.<br /> On the other hand, Krivelevich, Kwan and Sudakov recently proved that for every n-vertex graph G with minimum degree at least &alpha;n for any fixed &alpha;>0 and every n-vertex tree T with bounded maximum degree, one can still find a copy of T in G with high probability after adding O(n) randomly-chosen edges to G.<br /> We extend this result to trees with unbounded maximum degree. More precisely, for a given n<sup>&epsilon;</sup> ≤ &Delta;≤ cn/log n and &alpha;>0, we determined the precise number (up to a constant factor) of random edges that we need to add to an arbitrary n-vertex graph G with minimum degree &alpha;n in order to guarantee with high probability a copy of any fixed T with maximum degree at most &Delta;. This is joint work with Felix Joos.
