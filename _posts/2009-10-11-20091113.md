  <p>
    We first present how to extend Ramanujan&#8217;s method in partition congruences and show a congruence relation that the coefficients of the quotient of generating series for partitions and sums of squares satisfy. Then we observe a combinatorial interpretation of the product of them and see whether we could find some arithmetic properties of its coefficients.
