  <p>
    Lovász and Plummer conjectured that there exists a fixed positive constant c such that every cubic n-vertex graph with no cutedge has at least 2<sup>cn</sup> perfect matchings. Their conjecture has been verified for bipartite graphs by Voorhoeve and planar graphs by Chudnovsky and Seymour. We prove that every claw-free cubic n-vertex graph with no cutedge has more than 2<sup>n/18</sup> perfect matchings, thus verifying the conjecture for claw-free graphs.
