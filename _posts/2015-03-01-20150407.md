<div class="abstract">
  Around 15 years ago, Aharoni and Haxell gave a wonderful generalization of Hall&#8217;s marriage theorem. Their proof introduced topological methods in matching theory which were further developed by Berger, Meshulam, and others. Recently, motivated by some geometric questions, we extended these methods further, and in this talk I&#8217;ll explain the ideas and some of our results.
