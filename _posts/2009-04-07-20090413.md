<div class="abstract">
  The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is a widely-used algorithmic approach for randomly sampling from and estimating the cardinality of large sets. In this talk I will give an introduction to the MCMC approach. Then I will explain a more sophisticated variant that gives a polynomial-time algorithm to approximate the permanent of a non-negative matrix. In graph-theoretic terminology, the permanent corresponds to the number of perfect matchings of a bipartite graph.
