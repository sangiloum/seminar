<div class="abstract">
  The cycle counting rook numbers, hit numbers, and q-rook numberes and q-hit numbers have been studied by many people, and Briggs and Remmel introduced the theory of p-rook and p-hit numbers which is a rook theory model of the weath product of the cyclic group C<sub>p</sub> and the symmetric group S<sub>n</sub>.<br /> We extend the cycle-counting q-rook numberes and q-hit numbers to the Briggs-Remmel model. In such a settinig, we define multivariable version of the cycle-counting q-rook numbers and cycle-counting q-hit numbers where we keep track of cycles of pernutation and partial permutation of C<sub>p</sub> wearth product with S<sub>n</sub> according to the signs of the cycles.<br /> This work is a joint work with Jim Haglund at University of Pennsylvania and Jeff Remmel at UCSD.
