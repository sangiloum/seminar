  An <em>intertwine</em> of two graphs G and H is a graph that has both G and H as a minor and is minor-minimal with this property. In 1979, Lov√°sz and Unger conjectured that for any two graphs G and H, there are only a finite number of intertwines. This now follows from the graph minors project of Robertson and Seymour, although no &#8216;elementary&#8217; proof is known.<br /> In this talk, we consider intertwining problems for matroids. Bonin proved that there are matroids M and N that have infinitely many intertwines. However, it is conjectured that if M and N are both representable over a fixed finite field, then there are only finitely many intertwines. We prove a weak version of this conjecture where we intertwine &#8216;connectivities&#8217; instead of minors. No knowledge of matroid theory will be assumed.<br /> This is joint work with Bert Gerards (CWI, Amsterdam) and Stefan van Zwam (Princeton University).
