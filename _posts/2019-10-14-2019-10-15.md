<div class="abstract">
  For a graph $H$ and an integer $k\ge1$, the $k$-color Ramsey number $R_k(H)$ is the least integer $N$ such that every $k$-coloring of the edges of the complete graph $K_N$ contains a monochromatic copy of $H$. Let $C_m$ denote the cycle on $m\ge4 $ vertices. For odd cycles, Bondy and Erd\H{o}s in 1973 conjectured that for all $k\ge1$ and $n\ge2$, $R_k(C_{2n+1})=n\cdot 2^k+1$. Recently, this conjecture has been verified to be true for all fixed $k$ and all $n$ sufficiently large by Jenssen and Skokan; and false for all fixed $n$ and all $k$ sufficiently large by Day and Johnson. Even cycles behave rather differently in this context. Little is known about the behavior of $R_k(C_{2n})$ in general. In this talk we will present our recent results on Ramsey numbers of cycles under Gallai colorings, where a Gallai coloring is a coloring of the edges of a complete graph without rainbow triangles. We prove that the aforementioned conjecture holds for all $k$ and all $n$ under Gallai colorings. We also completely determine the Ramsey number of even cycles under Gallai colorings. Joint work with Dylan Bruce, Christian Bosse, Yaojun Chen and Fangfang Zhang.
