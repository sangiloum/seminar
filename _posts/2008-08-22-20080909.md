<div class="abstract">
  It is well known that the the central objects in the theory of symmetric functions, Schur functions, are generating functions of semistandard Young tableaux. We present a collection of generalizations of semistandard tableaux. The generating functions of these tableaux are symmetric functions occurring in the study of the (co)homology of the affine Grassmannian, and the K-(co)homology of the Grassmanian.
