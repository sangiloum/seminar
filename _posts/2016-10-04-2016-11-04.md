<div class="abstract">
  Helly&#8217;s theorem, a classical result in discrete geometry, asserts that if n>d convex subsets of R^d have empty intersection, some d+1 of them must already have empty intersection. I will discuss some topological generalizations of Helly&#8217;s theorem, where convexity is replaced by connectivity assumptions on the nonempty intersections, that lead to non-embeddability results of Borsuk-Ulam type and to variations on Leray&#8217;s acyclic cover theorem (or the Nerve theorem).
