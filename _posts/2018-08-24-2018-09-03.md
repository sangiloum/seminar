<div class="abstract">
  Counting problems on sets of integers with additive constraints have been extensively studied. In contrast, the counting problems for sets with multiplicative constraints remain largely unexplored. In this talk, we will discuss two such recent results, one on primitive sets and the other on multiplicative Sidon sets. Based on joint work with Peter Pach, and with Peter Pach and Richard Palincza.
