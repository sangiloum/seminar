<div class="abstract">
  A new algorithm will be presented for the path tsp, with an improved analysis and ratio. After the starting idea of deleting some edges of Christofides&#8217; trees, we do parity correction and eventual reconnection, taking the salesman to travel through a linear program determining the conditional probabilities for some of his choices; through matroid partition of a set of different matroids for a better choice of his initial spanning trees; and through some other adventures and misadventures.<br /> The proofs proceed by global and intuitively justified steps, where the trees do not hide the forests.<br /> One more pleasant piece of news is that we get closer to the conjectured approximation ratio of 3/2, and a hopefully last misadventure before finishing up this problem is that we still have to add 1/34 to this ratio, and also for the integrality gap. (The previous result was 8/5 with slight improvements.)<br /> This is joint work with Anke van Zuylen.
