<div class="abstract">
  For a tournament T, the <em>chromatic number</em> of T is the minimum number of transitive sets with union V(T). We say a set ? of tournaments is <em>heroic</em> if there exists c such that every tournament excluding all members of ? has chromatic number at most c. Berger et al. explicitly characterized all heroic sets of size one. In this talk, we study heroic sets of size two. This is a joint work with Maria Chudnovsky, Ilhee Kim, and Paul Seymour.
