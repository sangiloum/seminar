<div class="abstract">
  Given a simple polygon P, a point t in P, and a set of positive weights, we want to place the weights on the boundary of P in such a way that their barycenter comes to t. We show that there is always such a placement if the weights are balanced, i.e., no weight is larger than half of the total weight, and the placement can be found efficiently. We also study three-dimensional versions of the problem.</p>
