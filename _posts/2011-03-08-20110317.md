<div class="abstract">
  An L(j,k) labeling of a graph is a vertex labeling such that the difference of the labels of any two adjacent vertices is at least j and that of any two vertices of distance 2 is at least k. The minimum of the spans of all L(j,k)-labelings of G is denoted by <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_k%5Ej%28G%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='\lambda_k^j(G)' title='\lambda_k^j(G)' class='latex' />. Recently Haque and Jha proved if G is a direct product of complete graphs, then <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_k%5Ej%28G%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='\lambda_k^j(G)' title='\lambda_k^j(G)' class='latex' /> coincide with the trivial lower bound $(N-1)k$ where N is the order of G when j/k is within a certain bound.</p> 
  
  <p>
    In this paper, we suggest a new labeling method of such a graph G. With this method, we extend the range of j/k such that <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_k%5Ej%28G%29%3D%28N-1%29k&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='\lambda_k^j(G)=(N-1)k' title='\lambda_k^j(G)=(N-1)k' class='latex' /> holds. Moreover, we obtain an upper bound of <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_k%5Ej%28G%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='\lambda_k^j(G)' title='\lambda_k^j(G)' class='latex' /> for the remaining cases.
