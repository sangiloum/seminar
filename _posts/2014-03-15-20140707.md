  The choosability <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cchi_%5Cell%28G%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='\chi_\ell(G)' title='\chi_\ell(G)' class='latex' /> of a graph G is the minimum k such that having k colors available at each vertex guarantees a proper coloring. Given a toroidal graph G, it is known that <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cchi_%5Cell%28G%29%5Cleq+7&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='\chi_\ell(G)\leq 7' title='\chi_\ell(G)\leq 7' class='latex' />, and <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cchi_%5Cell%28G%29%3D7&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='\chi_\ell(G)=7' title='\chi_\ell(G)=7' class='latex' /> if and only if G contains <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_7&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='K_7' title='K_7' class='latex' />. Cai, Wang, and Zhu proved that a toroidal graph G without 7-cycles is 6-choosable, and <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cchi_%5Cell%28G%29%3D6&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='\chi_\ell(G)=6' title='\chi_\ell(G)=6' class='latex' /> if and only if G contains <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_6&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='K_6' title='K_6' class='latex' />. They also prove that a toroidal graph G without 6-cycles is 5-choosable, and conjecture that <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cchi_%5Cell%28G%29%3D5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='\chi_\ell(G)=5' title='\chi_\ell(G)=5' class='latex' /> if and only if G contains <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='K_5' title='K_5' class='latex' />. We disprove this conjecture by constructing an infinite family of non-4-colorable toroidal graphs with neither <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='K_5' title='K_5' class='latex' /> nor cycles of length at least 6; moreover, this family of graphs is embeddable on every surface except the plane and the projective plane. Instead, we prove the following slightly weaker statement suggested by Zhu: toroidal graphs containing neither <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%5E-_5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='K^-_5' title='K^-_5' class='latex' /> (a <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_5&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='K_5' title='K_5' class='latex' /> missing one edge) nor 6-cycles are 4-choosable. This is sharp in the sense that forbidding only one of the two structures does not ensure that the graph is 4-choosable.
