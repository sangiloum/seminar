<div class="abstract">
  If one draws the Hasse diagram for the face lattice of a polytope, this may appear to be the 1-skeleton of some other polytope. In 1971 Lindstr√∂m asked whether the intervals of a polytope&#8217;s face lattice ordered by containment can be realized as the face lattice of another polytope. If so, this would be the polytope appearing the Hasse diagram. In this talk, I will give necessary and sufficient conditions for the intervals of a polytope&#8217;s face lattice to be realizable, and I will provide a counter example showing that not every polytope satisfies these conditions.
