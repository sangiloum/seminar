  Coloring some perfect graphs
</div>

<div class="speaker">
  Maria Chudnovsky
</div>

<div class="abstract">
  A graph G is called <em>perfect</em> if for every induced subgraph H of G, the chromatic number and the clique number of H are equal. After the recent proof of the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem, and the discovery of a polynomial-time recognition algorithm, the central remaining open question about perfect graphs is finding a combinatorial polynomial-time coloring algorithm. (There is a polynomial-time algorithm known, using the ellipsoid method). Recently, we were able to find such an algorithm for a certain class of perfect graphs, that includes all perfect graphs admitting no balanced skew-partition. The algorithm is based on finding special &#8220;extremal&#8221; decompositions in such graphs; we also use the idea of &#8220;trigraphs&#8221;.<br /> This is joint work with Nicolas Trotignon, Theophile Trunck and Kristina Vuskovic.

  A separator theorem in minor-closed class of graphs
</div>

<div class="speaker">
  Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi
</div>

<div class="abstract">
  It is shown that for each t, there is a separator of size <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28t+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='O(t \sqrt{n})' title='O(t \sqrt{n})' class='latex' /> in any n-vertex graph G with no K<sub>t</sub>-minor.<br /> This settles a conjecture of Alon, Seymour and Thomas (J. Amer. Math. Soc., 1990 and STOC&#8217;90), and generalizes a result of Djidjev (1981), and Gilbert, Hutchinson and Tarjan (J. Algorithm, 1984), independently, who proved that every graph with n vertices and genus g has a separator of order <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Csqrt%7Bgn%7D%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='O(\sqrt{gn})' title='O(\sqrt{gn})' class='latex' />, because K<sub>t</sub> has genus &Omega;(t<sup>2</sup>).<br /> Joint work with Bruce Reed.

  On the chromatic number of digraphs
</div>

<div class="speaker">
  Bojan Mohar
</div>

<div class="abstract">
  Several reasons will be presented why the natural extension of the notion of undirected graph colorings is to partition the vertex set of a digraph into acyclic sets. Additionally, some recent results in this area, the proofs of which use probabilistic techniques, will be outlined.

  Colouring Tournaments
</div>

<div class="speaker">
  Paul Seymour

<div class="abstract">
  A <em>tournament</em> is a digraph obtained from a complete graph by directing its edges, and <em>colouring</em> a tournament means partitioning its vertex set into acyclic subsets (<em>acyclic</em> means the subdigraph induced on the subset has no directed cycles). This concept is quite like that for graph-colouring, but different. For instance, there are some tournaments H such that every tournament not containing H as a subdigraph has bounded chromatic number. We call them <em>heroes</em>; for example, all tournaments with at most four vertices are heroes.<br /> It turns out to be a fun problem to figure out exactly which tournaments are heroes. We have recently managed to do this, in joint work with Berger, Choromanski, Chudnovsky, Fox, Loebl, Scott and Thomass√©, and this talk is about the solution.
