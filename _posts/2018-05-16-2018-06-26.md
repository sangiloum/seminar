<div class="abstract">
  We discuss the number of proper colorings of hypercubes<br /> given q colors. When q=2, it is easy to see that there are only 2<br /> possible colorings. However, it is already highly nontrivial to figure<br /> out the number of colorings when q=3. Since Galvin (2002) proved the<br /> asymptotics of the number of 3-colorings, the rest cases remained open<br /> so far. In this talk, I will introduce a recent work on the number of<br /> 4-colorings, mainly focusing on how entropy can be used in counting.<br /> This is joint work with Jeff Kahn.
