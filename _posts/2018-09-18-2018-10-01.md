<div class="abstract">
  Any structure whose language is finite has a model of graph theory which is bi-interpretable with it. From this idea, Mekler further developed a way of interpreting a model into a group. This Mekler&#8217;s construction preserves various model-theoretic properties such as stability, simplicity, and NTP2, thus helps us find new group examples in model theory. In this talk, I will introduce to you what Mekler&#8217;s construction is and briefly show that this preserves NTP1.
