<div class="abstract">
  Laguerre histories are certain colored Motzkin paths with some weight for each elementary steps. In this talk, we study two famous bijections between permutations and Laguerre histories, made by Francon-Viennot and Foata-Zeilberger. This two bijections are enable us to give permutations as combinatorial interpretations of continued fractions. The former is associated in linear statistics and the latter be in cyclic statistics. Using two mappings, we are able to make various results about several statistics of permutations.
