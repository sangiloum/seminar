<div class="abstract">
  A path cover of a graph is a set of disjoint paths such that every vertex in the graph appears in one of the paths. We prove an upper bound for the minimum size of a path cover in a connected 4-regular graph with n vertices, confirming a conjecture by Graffiti.pc. We also determine the minimum number of vertices in a connected k-regular graph that is not Hamiltonian, and we solve the analogous problem for Hamiltonian paths.<br /> This is a partly joint work with Gexin Yu and Rui Xu.
