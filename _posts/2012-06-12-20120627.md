    A <em>dynamic coloring</em> of a graph G is a proper coloring of the vertex set V(G) such that for each vertex of degree at least 2, its neighbors receive at least two distinct colors. A dynamic k-coloring of a graph is a dynamic coloring with k colors. Note that the gap &chi;<sub>d</sub>(G) &#8211; &chi;(G) could be arbitrarily large for some graphs. An interesting problem is to study which graphs have small values of &chi;<sub>d</sub>(G) &#8211; &chi;(G).<br /> One of the most interesting problems about dynamic chromatic numbers is to find upper bounds of &chi;<sub>d</sub>(G)$ for planar graphs G. Lin and Zhao (2010) and Fan, Lai, and Chen (recently) showed that for every planar graph G, we have &chi;<sub>d</sub>(G)&le;5, and it was conjectured that &chi;<sub>d</sub>(G)&le;4 if G is a planar graph other than C<sub>5</sub>. (Note that &chi;<sub>d</sub>(C<sub>5</sub>)=5.)<br /> As a partial answer, Meng, Miao, Su, and Li (2006) showed that the dynamic chromatic number of Pseudo-Halin graphs, which are planar graphs, are at most 4, and Kim and Park (2011) showed that &chi;<sub>d</sub>(G)&le;4 if G is a planar graph with girth at least 7.<br /> In this talk we settle the above conjecture that &chi;<sub>d</sub>&le;4 if G is a planar graph other than C<sub>5</sub>. We also study the corresponding list coloring called a <em>list dynamic coloring</em>.<br /> This is joint work with Seog-Jin Kim and Won-Jin Park.
