<div class="abstract">
  Given a planar subdivision with n vertices, each face having a cone of possible directions of travel, our goal is to decide which vertices of the subdivision can be reached from a given starting point s. We give an O(n log n)-time algorithm for this problem, as well as an Î©(n log n) lower bound in the algebraic computation tree model. We prove that the generalization where two cones of directions per face are allowed is NP-hard.
