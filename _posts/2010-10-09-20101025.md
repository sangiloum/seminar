  <p>
    The cyclic sieving phenomenon is introduced by Reiner, Stanton and White in 2004. Since then this new topic attracts more and more attentions of researchers in recent years. In this talk we will introduce the cyclic sieving phenomenon and introduce some interesting old and new results. Finally we present a new development on constructing new cyclic sieving phenomena from new ones via elementary representation theory.
