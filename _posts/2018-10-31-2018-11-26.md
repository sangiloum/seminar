<div class="abstract">
  For a graph G, let f<sub>2</sub>(G) denote the largest number of vertices in a 2-regular subgraph of G. We determine the minimum of f<sub>2</sub>(G) over 3-regular n-vertex simple graphs G.<br /> To do this, we prove that every 3-regular multigraph with exactly c cut-edges has a 2-regular subgraph that omits at most max{0,⎣(c-1)/2⎦} vertices.<br /> More generally, every n-vertex multigraph with maximum degree 3 and m edges has a 2-regular subgraph that omits at most max{0, ⎣(3n-2m+c-1)/2⎦} vertices.<br /> These bounds are sharp; we describe the extremal multigraphs.<br /> This is joint work with Ringi Kim, Alexandr V. Kostochka, Boram Park, and Douglas B. West.
