<div class="abstract">
  In this talk I will discuss two problems of Andries Brouwer.<br /> In the first one he asked whether the minimal number of vertices you need to delete from a strongly regular graph with valency k and intersection numbers &lambda;, &mu;, in order to disconnect it and such that each resulting component has at least two vertices is 2k-2-&lambda;. We will show that there are strongly where you can use a smaller number of vertices to disconnect it in this way, but we also will give some positive results.<br /> The second question we discuss is how connected a distance-regular graph is far from a fixed vertex.<br /> This is joint work with Sebastian Cioaba and Kijung Kim.
