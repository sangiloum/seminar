  A <em>signed graph</em> is a pair (G, σ), where G is a graph and σ: E(G) → {1,-1} is a signature of G. A set S of integers is <em>symmetric</em> if I∈S implies that -i∈S.&nbsp;A <em>k-colouring</em> of (G,σ) is a mapping f:V(G) → N<sub>k</sub> such that for each edge e=uv, f(x)≠σ(e) f(y), where N<sub>k</sub> is a symmetric integer set of size k.&nbsp;We define the <em>signed chromatic number</em> of a graph G to be the minimum integer k such that for any signature σ of G, (G, σ) has a k-colouring. Let f(n,k) be the maximum signed chromatic number of an n-vertex k-chromatic graph. This paper determines the value of f(n,k) for all positive integers n ≥ k.&nbsp;Then we study list colouring of signed graphs.&nbsp;A list assignment L of G is called <em>symmetric</em> if L(v) is a symmetric integer set for each vertex v.&nbsp;The <em>weak signed choice number</em> ch<sub>±</sub><sup>w</sup>(G) of a graph G is defined to be the minimum integer k such that for any symmetric k-list assignment L of G,&nbsp;for any signature σ on G, there is a proper L-colouring of (G, σ). We prove that&nbsp;the difference ch<sub>±</sub><sup>w</sup>(G)-χ<sub>±</sub>(G) can be arbitrarily large. On the other hand, ch<sub>±</sub><sup>w</sup>(G) is bounded from above by twice the list vertex arboricity of G. Using this result, we prove that ch<sub>±</sub><sup>w</sup>(K<sub>2⋆n</sub>)= χ<sub>±</sub>(K<sub>2⋆n</sub>) = ⌈2n/3⌉ + ⌊2n/3⌋.&nbsp;This is joint work with Ringi Kim and Xuding Zhu.
