<div class="abstract">
  We prove a generalization of Pal&#8217;s 1921 conjecture that if a convex shape P can be placed in any orientation inside a convex shape Q in the plane, then P can also be turned continuously through 360 degrees inside Q. We also prove a lower bound of Î©(m n<sup>2</sup>) on the number of combinatorially distinct maximal placements of a convex m-gon P in a convex n-gon Q. This matches the upper bound proven by Agarwal et al.
