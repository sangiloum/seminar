<div class="abstract">
  <p>
    A <i>rendezvous number</i> for a metric space M is a number a such that, for every finite subset Q of M, there is an element p in M, such that the average distance from p to the elements in Q is a.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    O. Gross showed in 1964 that every compact connected metric space has precisely one rendezvous number. This result is a consequence of von Neumann&#8217;s min-max theorem in game theory.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In an article in the American Math. Monthly 93(1986) 260-275, J. Cleary and A. A. Morris asked if a (more) elementary proof of Gross&#8217; result exists.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In this talk I shall formulate a min-max result for real matrices which immediately implies these results of Gross and von Neumann.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The proof is easy and involves only mathematical induction.
