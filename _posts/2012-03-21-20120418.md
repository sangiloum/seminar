<div class="abstract">
  The well-known Ohba Conjecture says that every graph G with |V(G)|&le; 2&chi;(G)+1 is chromatic choosable.<br /> This paper studies an on-line version of Ohba Conjecture. We prove that unlike the off-line case, for k&ge;3, the complete multipartite graph K<sub>2*(k-1), 3</sub> is not on-line chromatic-choosable. Based on this result, the on-line version of Ohba Conjecture is modified as follows: Every graph G with |V(G)|&ge; 2&chi;(G) is on-line chromatic choosable. We present an explicit strategy to show that for any positive integer k, the graph K<sub>2*k</sub> is on-line chromatic-choosable. We then present a minimal function g for which the graph K<sub>2*(k-1), 3</sub> is on-line g-choosable. This is joint work with Young Soo Kwon, Daphne Der-Fen Liu, and Xuding Zhu.
