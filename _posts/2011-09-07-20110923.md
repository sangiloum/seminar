<div class="abstract">
  In one of their joint papers, Victor Reiner and Dennis Stanton introduced a (q,t)-generalization of the binomial coefficient. There was an interesting conjecture for the cases when qâ‰¤-2 is a negative integer. In this talk, I will prove this conjecture and try to give some combinatorial sense using integer partitions.
