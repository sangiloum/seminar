<div class="abstract">
  A hex tree is an ordered tree of which each vertex has updegree 0, 1, or 2, and an edge from a vertex of updegree 1 is either left, median, or right. In this talk, we introduce an enumeration problem of symmetric hex trees and describe a bijection between symmetric hex trees and a certain class of supertrees. Some algebraic properties of the polynomials arising in this procedure also will be discussed.
