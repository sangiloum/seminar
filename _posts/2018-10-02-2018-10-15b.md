<div class="abstract">
  We say a subgraph H of an edge-colored graph is rainbow if all edges in H has distinct colors. The concept of rainbow subgraphs generalizes the concept of transversals in latin squares.<br /> In this talk, we discuss how these concepts are related and we introduce a result regarding approximate decompositions of graphs into rainbow subgraphs. This has implications on transversals in latin square. It is based on a joint work with Kühn, Kupavskii and Osthus.
