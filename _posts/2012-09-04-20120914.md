<div class="abstract">
  A graph G is called H-saturated if it does not contain any copy of H, but for any edge e in the complement of G the graph G+e contains some H. The minimum size of an n-vertex H-saturated graph is denoted by sat(n,H). We prove sat(n,C<sub>k</sub>) = n + n/k + O((n/k<sup>2</sup>) + k<sup>2</sup>) holds for all n&ge;k&ge;3, where C<sub>k</sub> is a cycle with length k.<br /> Joint work with Zoltan Füredi.
