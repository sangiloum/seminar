  <p>
    The study of electric potentials on graphs has a close connection with probability theory. On distance-regular graphs the theory is particularly elegant, as known results concerning such graphs allow explicit calculations to be made. In this talk, I will introduce these topics and discuss some recent results that Jacobus Koolen and I have obtained, as well as some conjectures and open problems.
