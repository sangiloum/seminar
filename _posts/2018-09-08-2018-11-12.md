<div class="abstract">
  Mathematical optimization is a field that studies algorithms, given an objective function and a feasible set, to find the element that maximizes or minimizes the objective function from the feasible set. While most interesting optimization problems are NP-hard and unlikely to admit efficient algorithms that find the exact optimal solution, many of them admit efficient &#8220;approximation algorithms&#8221; that find an approximate optimal solution.<br /> Continuous and discrete optimization are the two main branches of mathematical optimization that have been primarily studied in different contexts. In this talk, I will introduce my recent results that bridge some of important continuous and discrete optimization problems, such as matrix low-rank approximation and Unique Games. At the heart of the connection is the problem of approximately computing the operator norm of a matrix with respect to various norms, which will allow us to borrow mathematical tools from functional analysis.
