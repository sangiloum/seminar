  <p>
    The graph finding problem is to find the edges of an unknown graph by using a certain type of queries. Its extension to hypergraphs is closely related to the problem of learning linkage in molecular biology and artificial intelligence. In this talk, we introduce the hypergraph finding problem and the linkage learning problem and present our recent results for the query complexity of those problems.
