<div class="abstract">
  One of the most well-studied criteria in Graph Drawing is straight-line<br /> planar representations of graphs. There are three seminal results on straight-line drawings of planar graphs: the Steinitz’s Theorem, Fary’s theorem, and Tutte’s Barycenter Theorem.<br /> In this talk, I will first review the recent advances in Graph Drawing on extending the Steinitz’s Theorem and Tutte’s Barycenter Theorem to non-convex representations: Star-shaped polyhedra and Star-shaped drawings. Then, I will announce the latest results on extending Fary’s theorem to non-planar graphs, namely 1-planar graphs.
