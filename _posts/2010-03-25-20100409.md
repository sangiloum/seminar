    In 1989, Stephenson and Zelen derived an elegant formula for the information I<sub>ab</sub> contained in all possible paths between two nodes a and b in a network, which is described as follows. Given a finite weighted graph G and its Laplacian matrix L, the <em>combinatorial Green&#8217;s function</em> <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='\mathcal{G}' title='\mathcal{G}' class='latex' />, of G is the inverse of L+J, where J is the all 1&#8217;s matrix. Then, it was shown that I<sub>ab</sub>=(g<sub>aa</sub>+g<sub>bb</sub>-2g<sub>ab</sub>)<sup>-1</sup>, where g<sub>ij</sub> is the (i,j)-th entry of <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BG%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='\mathcal{G}' title='\mathcal{G}' class='latex' />. In this talk, we prove an intriguing combinatorial formula for I<sub>ab</sub>:

    where <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ckappa%28G%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='\kappa(G)' title='\kappa(G)' class='latex' /> is the complexity, or tree-number, of G, and G<sub>a*b</sub> is obtained from G by identifying two vertices a and b. We will discuss several implications of this new formula, including the equivalence of I<sub>ab</sub> and the effective conductance between two nodes in electrical networks.
