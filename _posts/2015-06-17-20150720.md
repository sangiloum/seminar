  Lecture 1: A Landscape of Graph Polynomials.</p> 
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      We introduce the most prominent graph polynomials (characteristic, Laplacian, chromatic, matching, Tutte) and discuss how to compare them.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    Lecture 2: Why is the Chromatic Polynomial a Polynomial?
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      We give an alternative proof for the fact that the chromatic polynomial is indeed a polynomial. From this we introduce generalized chromatic polynomials, and show that this actually represents the most general case; Every (reasonably defined) graph polynomial can be represented as a generalized chromatic polynomial.
    </p>

    Lecture 3: Hankel matrices and Graph Polynomials.
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      We introduce Hankel matrices of graph paramaters, which generalize Lovasz&#8217; connection matrices. We show that many (but not all) graph polynomials have Hankel matrices of finite rank. We show how to use the Finite Rank Property to show definability/non-definability of graph parameters/polynomials in Monadic Second Order Logic.
