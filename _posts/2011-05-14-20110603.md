<div class="abstract">
  We show that an n-vertex hypergraph with no r-regular subgraph has at most 2<sup>n-1</sup>+r-2 edges. We conjecture that if n>r, then every n-vertex hypergraph with no r-regular subgraph having the maximum number of edges contains a full star, meaning 2<sup>n-1</sup> distinct edges containing a single vertex. We prove this conjecture for n&ge;425. This is joint work with Alexandr V. Kostochka.
