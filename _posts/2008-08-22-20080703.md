  <p>
    The Euler number E<sub>n</sub> counts the number of alternating permutations on the set [n]. It is well known that its exponential generating function equals Tan <em>z</em> + Sec <em>z</em>. For this reason, E<sub>2n</sub> and E<sub>2n+1</sub> are called <em>secant numbers</em> and <em>tangent numbers</em>, respectively. Certain polynomials arising in series expansions for zeros of generalized Rogers-Ramanujan functions provide a q-analog of the tangent numbers, which is part of a wider class of polynomials with similar combinatorial interpretations. In this talk, we will discuss various q-Euler numbers. This is a joint work with Tim Huber from Iowa State University.</div>
