<div class="abstract">
  Let P be a graph property. We look at graph colorings with k colors where each color class induces a graph satisfying P. By a result of Makowsky and Zilber (2005) the number of such colorings ?<sub>P</sub>(G;k) is a polynomial in k. We present recent results and open problems on the complexity of evaluating ?<sub>P</sub>(G;&lambda;) for various properties P and (not only integer) values of &lambda;.<br /> This is joint work with A. Goodall, M. Hermann, T. Kotek and S. Noble which was initiated during last year&#8217;s program &#8220;Counting Complexity and Phase Transitions&#8221;.
