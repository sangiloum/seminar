<div class="abstract">
  A split of a graph is a partition <i>(A,B)</i> of the vertex set <i>V(G)</i> having subsets <i>A</i><sub></sub> of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i><sub></sub> of <i>B</i> such that |<i>A</i>|,|<i>B</i>| > 1 and a vertex <i>a</i> in <i>A</i> is adjacent to a vertex <i>b</i> in <i>B</i> if and only if a is in <i>A</i><sub></sub> and <i>b</i> is in <i>B</i><sub></sub>. A graph is prime (with respect to the split decomposition) if it has no split.</p> 
  
  <p>
    We prove that for each <i>n</i>, there exists <i>N</i> such that every prime graph on at least <i>N</i> vertices contains a vertex-minor isomorphic to either a cycle of length <i>n</i> or a graph consisting of two disjoint cliques of size <i>n</i> joined by a matching.
  </p>

    In this talk, we plan to describe a main tool, which is called a blocking sequence in a prime graph, and we will describe two big steps of the proof. And we will pose some open problems behind this result.

    This is a joint work with Sang-il Oum.
