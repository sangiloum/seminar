    One of the most fundamental properties of a connected graph is the existence of a spanning tree. Also the number &tau;(G) of spanning trees is an important graph invariant. It plays a crucial role in Kirchhoff&#8217;s classical theory of electrical networks, for example in computing driving point resistances. More recently, &tau;(G) is one of the values of the Tutte polynomial which now plays a central role in statistical mechanics. So are a(G), the number of acyclic orientations, and c(G), the number of orientations in which every edge is in a directed cycle. As a first step towards convexity properties of the Tutte polynomial, Merino and Welsh conjectured that

    for every loopless and bridgeless multigraph G. We shall here prove that &tau;(G) &le; c(G) for all loopless and bridgeless multigraphs with n vertices and at least 4n edges and that &tau;(G) &le; a(G) for all loopless multigraphs with n vertices and at most 16n/15 edges. We also verify the conjecture for cubic graphs (which are in between these two bounds).
