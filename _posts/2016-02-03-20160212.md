<div class="abstract">
  In this talk, I attempt to provide a comprehensive introduction to the matroid properties that hold for almost all matroids.<br /> Welsh conjectured that almost all matroids are paving, open for nearly 50 years. If true, the properties of paving matroids translate to almost all matroids, such as non-representability, concentrated ranks, high connectivity and so on. We shall see the related properties that are shown to hold for almost all matroids with some of the proofs. An overview of recent progress and possible further directions will also be presented.
