<div class="abstract">
  Recently, Kenyon and Wilson introduced a certain matrix M in order to compute pairing probabilities of what they call the double-dimer model. They showed that the absolute value of each entry of the inverse matrix M<sup>-1</sup> is equal to the number of certain Dyck tilings of a skew shape. They conjectured two formulas on the sum of the absolute values of the entries in a row or a column of M<sup>-1</sup>. In this talk we prove the two conjectures. As a consequence we obtain that the sum of the absolute values of all entries of M<sup>-1</sup> is equal to the number of complete matchings. We also find a bijection between Dyck tilings and complete matchings.<br /> This talk is based on the following paper: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.5558">arxiv:1108.5558</a>.
