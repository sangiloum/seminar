<div class="abstract">
  Many combinatorial problems and arguments concerning finite point sets in the Euclidean plane (or higher dimensions) often do not use the linear structure. A more general concept is that of an Oriented Matroid (OM). It is well-known that every OM can realized by pseudolines, and in fact most oriented matroids can not be realized by straight lines.<br /> Recently, Alfreod Hubard (Courant Institute) and myself have found a new way to represent an OM by convex sets which retains much more of the &#8220;straightness&#8221; of the Euclidean plane. Interestingly, in our model the isotopy conjecture holds in a very strong sense, and it unifies several aspects of pseudoline arrangements.
