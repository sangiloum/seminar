<div class="abstract">
  The Ramsey number of a graph G is the minimum integer n for which every edge coloring of the complete graph on n vertices with two colors admits a monochromatic copy of G. It was first introduced in 1930 by Ramsey, who proved that the Ramsey number of complete graphs are finite, and applied it to a problem of formal logic. This fundamental result gave birth to the subfield of Combinatorics referred to as Ramsey theory which informally can be described as the study of problems that can be grouped under the common theme that “Every large system contains a large well-organized subsystem.”<br /> In this talk, I will review the history of Ramsey numbers of graphs and discuss recent developments.
