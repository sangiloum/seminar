<div class="abstract">
  Let $F$ and $H$ be graphs. The subgraph counting function $\operatorname{ex}(n,H,F)$ is defined as the maximum possible number of subgraphs $H$ in an $n$-vertex $F$-free graph. This function is a direct generalization of the Tur치n function as $\operatorname{ex}(n,F)=\operatorname{ex}(n,K_2,F)$. The systematic study of $\operatorname{ex}(n,H,F)$ was initiated by Alon and Shikhelman in 2016 who generalized several classical results in extremal graph theory to the subgraph counting setting. Prior to their paper, a number of individual cases were investigated; a well-known example is the question to determine the maximum number of pentagons in a triangle-free graph. In this talk we will survey results on the function $\operatorname{ex}(n,H,F)$ including a number of recent papers. We will also discuss this function&#8217;s connection to hypergraph Tur치n problems.
