<div class="abstract">
  A graph is (d<sub>1</sub>, &#8230;, d<sub>r</sub>)-colorable if its vertex set can be partitioned into r sets V<sub>1</sub>, &#8230;, V<sub>r</sub> where the maximum degree of the graph induced by V<sub>i</sub> is at most d<sub>i</sub> for each i in {1, &#8230;, r}.<br /> Given r and d<sub>1</sub>, &#8230;, d<sub>r</sub>, determining if a (sparse) graph is (d<sub>1</sub>, &#8230;, d<sub>r</sub>)-colorable has attracted much interest.<br /> For example, the Four Color Theorem states that all planar graphs are 4-colorable, and therefore (0, 0, 0, 0)-colorable.<br /> The question is also well studied for partitioning planar graphs into three parts.<br /> For two parts, it is known that for given d<sub>1</sub> and d<sub>2</sub>, there exists a planar graph that is not (d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>)-colorable.<br /> Therefore, it is natural to study the question for planar graphs with girth conditions.<br /> Namely, given g and d<sub>1</sub>, determine the minimum d<sub>2</sub>=d<sub>2</sub>(g, d<sub>1</sub>) such that planar graphs with girth g are (d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>)-colorable. We continue the study and ask the same question for graphs that are embeddable on a fixed surface.<br /> Given integers k, &gamma;, g we completely characterize the smallest k-tuple (d<sub>1</sub>, &#8230;, d<sub>k</sub>) in lexicographical order such that each graph of girth at least g that is embeddable on a surface of Euler genus &gamma; is (d<sub>1</sub>, &#8230;, d<sub>k</sub>)-colorable.<br /> All of our results are tight, up to a constant multiplicative factor for the degrees d<sub>i</sub> depending on g.<br /> In particular, we show that a graph embeddable on a surface of Euler genus &gamma; is (0, 0, 0, K<sub>1</sub>(&gamma;))-colorable and (2, 2, K<sub>2</sub>(&gamma;))-colorable, where K<sub>1</sub>(&gamma;) and K<sub>2</sub>(&gamma;) are linear functions in &gamma;.This talk is based on results and discussions with <a href="http://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/~hojinchoi/">H.
