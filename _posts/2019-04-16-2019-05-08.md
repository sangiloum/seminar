<div class="abstract">
  Let N be the set of natural numbers. A set A⊂N is called a Sidon set if the sums a<sub>1</sub>+a<sub>2</sub>, with a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>∈S and a<sub>1</sub>≤a<sub>2</sub>, are distinct, or equivalently, if<br /> |(x+w)−(y+z)|≥1<br /> for every x,y,z,w∈S with x<y≤z<w. We define strong Sidon sets as follows:</p> 
  
  <p>
    For a constant α with 0≤α<1, a set S⊂N is called an α-strong Sidon set if<br /> |(x+w)−(y+z)|≥w<sup>α</sup><br /> for every x,y,z,w∈S with x<y≤z<w.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The motivation of strong Sidon sets is that a strong Sidon set generates many Sidon sets by altering each element a bit. This infers that a dense strong Sidon set will guarantee a dense Sidon set contained in a sparse random subset of N.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In this talk, we are interested in how dense a strong Sidon set can be. This is joint work with Yoshiharu Kohayakawa, Carlos Gustavo Moreira and Vojtěch Rödl.
