<div class="abstract">
  Graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.<br /> Graph decomposition problems ask to partition the edges of large/dense graphs into small/sparse graphs.<br /> In this talk, we introduce several famous graph decomposition problems, related puzzles and known results on the problems.
