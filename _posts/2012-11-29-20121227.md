<div class="abstract">
  Brooks&#8217; Theorem states that for a graph G with maximum degree &Delta;(G) at least 3, the chromatic number is at most &Delta;(G) when the clique number is at most &Delta;(G). Vizing proved that the list chromatic number is also at most &Delta;(G) under the same conditions. Borodin and Kostochka conjectured that a graph G with maximum degree at least 9 must be (&Delta;(G)-1)-colorable when the clique number is at most &Delta;(G)-1; this was proven for graphs with maximum degree at least 10<sup>14</sup> by Reed. We prove an analogous result for the list chromatic number; namely, we prove that a graph G with &Delta;(G)&ge; 10<sup>20</sup> is (&Delta;(G)-1)-choosable when the clique number is at most &Delta;(G)-1. This is joint work with H. A. Kierstead, L. Rabern, and B. Reed.
