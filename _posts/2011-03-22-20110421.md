  <p>
    Vertex colouring of graphs is an active research area in graph theory. It has wide applications to practical problems and also has many theoretically deep results and challenging problems. Circular colouring of graphs is a refinement of the conventional vertex colouring of graphs. It has atttract a lot of attention in the past twenty years, and becomes an important branch of chromatic graph theory, with many exciting results and new techniques. This talk gives a survey on research in this area.
