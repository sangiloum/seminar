<div class="abstract">
  The purpose of this talk is to study the finite field analog of the Erdős distance problem. First, the conjecture and known results on the problem are reviewed. Second, we introduce basic skills to deduce results on the problem. Finally, we address how to improve currently known results on the Erdős distance problem.
