    We present a coefficient formula which provides some information about the polynomial map <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%5Cvert_%7BI_1%5Ctimes%5Ccdots%5Ctimes+I_n%7D&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='P\vert_{I_1\times\cdots\times I_n}' title='P\vert_{I_1\times\cdots\times I_n}' class='latex' /> when only incomplete information about a polynomial <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28X_1%2C%5Cldots%2CX_n%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt='P(X_1,\ldots,X_n)' title='P(X_1,\ldots,X_n)' class='latex' /> is given. It is an integrative generalization and sharpening of several known results and has many applications, among these are:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1. The fact that polynomials <img src='http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=+P%28X_1%29%5Cneq+0&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=000000&#038;s=0' alt=' P(X_1)\neq 0' title=' P(X_1)\neq 0' class='latex' /> in just one variable have at most deg(P) roots.<br /> 2. Alon and Tarsi&#8217;s Combinatorial Nullstellensatz.<br /> 3. Chevalley and Warning&#8217;s Theorem about the number of simultaneous zeros of systems of polynomials over finite fields.<br /> 4. Ryser&#8217;s Permanent Formula.<br /> 5. Alon&#8217;s Permanent Lemma.<br /> 6. Alon and Tarsi&#8217;s Theorem about orientations and colorings of graphs.<br /> 7. Scheim&#8217;s formula for the number of edge n-colorings of planar n-regular graphs.<br /> 8. Alon, Friedland and Kalai&#8217;s Theorem about regular subgraphs.<br /> 9. Alon and Füredi&#8217;s Theorem about cube covers.<br /> 10. Cauchy and Davenport&#8217;s Theorem from additive number theory.<br /> 11. Erdős, Ginzburg and Ziv&#8217;s Theorem from additive number theory.
