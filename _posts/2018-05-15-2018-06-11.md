<div class="abstract">
  For an unknown graph G on n vertices, given random k-colorings of G, can one learn the edges of G? We present results on identifiability/non-identifiability of the graph G and efficient algorithms for learning G. The results have interesting connections to statistical physics phase transitions.<br /> This is joint work with Antonio Blanca, Zongchen Chen, and Daniel Stefankovic.
